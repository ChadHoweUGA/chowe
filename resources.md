There are lots of ways to stay active in the linguistics community at UGA. In Romance Languages, there are [weekly conversation groups](http://rom.uga.edu/conversation-groups-and-language-tables) for French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish (and sometimes Catalan), as well as the [Romance Languages Colloquium](http://rom.uga.edu/events/all). In the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.linguistics.uga.edu/department-calendar), there are regular talks by internal and external speakers and several events hosted by the [Linguistics Society at the University of Georgia (LSUGA)](http://www.linguistics.uga.edu/lsuga), including the [Linguistics Conference at UGA](http://www.linguistics.uga.edu/linguistics-conference), now in its sixth iteration. The [UGA DigiLab](https://digi.uga.edu/digilab/#1544564021635-6ae22572-cb2d) has a very nice collection of workshops presented by faculty and students from UGA (and beyond). Finally, if you're interested in joining one of our listservs, please contact me for access to either the **Romance Linguistics Listserv (ROMLING-L)** or the **Latin American Indigenous Languages Listserv (LAIL-L)**.
