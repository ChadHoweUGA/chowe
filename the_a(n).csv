A0T,b_definite,a_nondetermined,d_proper,"This apparently backward causality , if true , would cause problems for identity theories of mind and has been used by dualists like John Eccles to support their position , with the backward step in time made by a non-physical mind . Libet 's second set of experiments , described in 1985 , is even more striking .

CAN,b_definite,b_determined,a_count_sg,"The Anglo-French-German study was not principally about new technology , but its findings are of great relevance to the subsequent Anglo-German study specifically concerned with work organisation and CNC technology in manufacturing industry . The former study compared carefully matched samples of British , French , and German factories , and having held as constant as possible factors such as size of enterprise , technology , and the firm 's environment , discovered substantial differences in the way work was organised in the three countries , concluding that these could best be accounted for by features of each nation 's culture , and in particular its educational and occupational structures . Caricaturing their findings somewhat , they discovered that West German firms had flatter , more widely based pyramids of management hierarchy than French firms , and that British firms tended to have forms of work organisation that were not pyramidal because there was extensive use of line and staff relationships . They attributed these differences primarily to the fact that in West Germany there was an extensive system of vocational training , further in-service training , awarding of qualifications , and positioning in ",<<< the >>>," hierarchy on the basis of such qualifications . This meant that management were able to push decision making well down the hierarchy , giving those actually operating the CNC machines much autonomy , and expecting a high level of integration of the various functions such as quality control , work planning , programming of the machine , and machine setting to take place via those operatives actually on the shop floor . In France , by contrast , there was a polarisation of skills , characterised by a high level of expertise among the managerial cadres and technicians , and a very low proportion of skilled craftspeople among the shop-floor workers .
