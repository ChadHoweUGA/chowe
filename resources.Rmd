There are lots of ways to stay active in the linguistics community at UGA. In Romance Languages, there are [weekly conversation groups](http://rom.uga.edu/conversation-groups-and-language-tables) for French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish (and sometimes Catalan), as well as the [Romance Languages Colloquium](http://rom.uga.edu/events/all). In the [Department of Linguistics](http://www.linguistics.uga.edu/department-calendar), there are regular talks by internal and external speakers and several events hosted by the [Linguistics Society at the University of Georgia (LSUGA)](http://www.linguistics.uga.edu/lsuga), including the [Linguistics Conference at UGA](http://www.linguistics.uga.edu/linguistics-conference), now in its sixth iteration. The [UGA DigiLab](https://digi.uga.edu/digilab/#1544564021635-6ae22572-cb2d) has a very nice collection of workshops presented by faculty and students from UGA (and beyond).
