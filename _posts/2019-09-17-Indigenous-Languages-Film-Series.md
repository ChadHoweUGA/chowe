Please mark your calendars for September 24 and 25, 2019 and plan on joining us at Athens Ciné. Starting at 5:15pm on each of these dates, we will present two Latin American films on indigenous languages and cultures with special introductory comments and post-screening Q & A with the films’ directors. Thanks to broad financial support from the UGA community, these events are FREE and open to the public of all ages. Please publicize this event widely and encourage public participation.

On **Tuesday, September 24**, we have the pleasure to show [https://athenscine.com/movie/los-ojos-del-camino](Los Ojos del Camino) in Quechua with English subtitles. Director Rodrigo Otero Heraud will join us for comments and questions from the viewing public.

On **Wednesday, September 2**5, we are proud to screen [https://athenscine.com/movie/los-ojos-del-camino](Lantéc Chaná) in Chaná and Spanish with English subtitles. Director Marina Zeising will be with us for comments and questions from the viewing public.

These events celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month and the [https://en.iyil2019.org/](UNESCO International Year of Indigenous Languages). The following organizations have generously supported this event: the UGA Willson Center, the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Institute (LACSI), Department of Linguistics, Department of Romance Languages, Department of Theatre and Film Studies, Department of History, Department of Sociology, and the Institute of Native American Studies.

Refreshments will not be provided, but the Ciné snack bar will be open and available for purchases.
