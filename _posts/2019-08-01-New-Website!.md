I'm in the process of transitioning my website from the [Franklin College site](http://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/chowe/) to this new site. Once I figure out all the bells and whistles in the Github sites functionality, I'll add a few more things. For now, I hope this will suffice. Please feel free to contact me with questions and suggestions: [mailto](mailto:chowe@uga.edu).
